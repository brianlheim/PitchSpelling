# General definition

Rules can be applied at the [**node-**](#node-level), [**edge-**](#edge-level), or [**graph-**](#graph-level)level:

- **Node-level rules**:
  - Applied to single `SpelledPitchClass` values
  - e.g., "avoid double flats/sharps"
- **Edge-level rules**:
  - Applied to all pairs `SpelledPitchClass` values in the graph
  - e.g., "avoid augmented unisons"
- **Graph-level rules**:
  - Applied to entire graph
  - Does not apply "double jeopardy" â€” penalizes only once if there are one or more instances of rule-breaking
  - e.g., "avoid eighth tone arrow direction conflicts"
  
Rules return a cost value, [0,1], which is later scaled by the program to allow rule weighting and user-controlled preferences.

# Node-level rules
### `(SpelledPitchClass) -> Float`

### R<sub>n1</sub>: Double sharps / double flats
* 1 if **A<sub>q</sub>** is `bb` or `x`
* 0 otherwise

### R<sub>n2</sub>: Bad enharmonics
* 1 if (**A<sub>l</sub>**, **A<sub>q</sub>**) = `(b, sharp)` or `(c, flat)` or `(e, sharp)` or `(f, flat)`
* 0 otherwise

_maybe this should use b, db, and bb instead of just b--this would overlap with other rules but maybe this is a good thing?_

### R<sub>n3</sub>: Combining quarter tones and eighth tones
* 1 if **A<sub>q res</sub>** `== 0.5` and **A<sub>e</sub>** `!= 0`
* 0 otherwise

> In the case of an eighth-tone resolution spelling, prefer half-step accidental body values over quarter-step accidental body values. 

### R<sub>n4</sub>: Three-quarter-step values
* 1 if **A<sub>q</sub>** is `three-quarter-flat` or `three-quarter-sharp`
* 0 otherwise

# Edge-level rules
`(SpelledPitchClass) -> (SpelledPitchClass) -> Float`

### R<sub>e1</sub>: avoid unisons (all unisons are augmented since we use a set of unique elements going into the problem)
* 1 if Al = Bl
* 0 otherwise

### R<sub>e2</sub>: avoid crossovers (Cb and B# for instance)
* 1 if ?
* 0 otherwise

_not sure how to implement this one, but I think you have to include checks on the quarter-tone directions_

### R<sub>E3</sub>: avoid augmented/diminished intervals
* 0.2 * the degree of augmentation/diminution of the interval (A,B)
* 0 if (A,B) is not agumented or diminished

# Graph-level rules
`[SpelledPitchClass] -> Float`

### R<sub>g1</sub>: avoid rough spellings in opposite directions
* 1 if for any A, B in S, sign(Aq) * sign(Bq) = -1
* 0 otherwise

### R<sub>g2</sub>: avoid eighth tone direction conflict
* 1 if for any A, B in S, sign(Ae) * sign(Be) = -1
* 0 otherwise
