#ideas for varying the algorithm as it stands to reduce computational cost

* remove reacharound rule (special case of aug/dim rule)
* remove unisons rule (special case of aug/dim rule)
* don't sort possibilities by cost, just find minimum element
* eliminate graphs when cost is assessed if their cost is > C<sub>max</sub>
