how i understand the problem.

general solution:

1. process inputs
2. assign costs to graphs (explore output space)
3. select lowest-cost graph

strategy for verticalities:

1. generate intervals from input pcs
2. sort intervals by decreasing expected loss variance (james's interval sorting thing)
3. find low-cost graphs through recursive tree traversal
4. select lowest-cost graph
